## TIL
TLDR; tuple -> immutable; list -> mutable.
Tuples are fixed size in nature whereas lists are dynamic.
In other words, a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable.

    You can't add elements to a tuple. Tuples have no append or extend method.
    You can't remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove or pop method.
    You can find elements in a tuple, since this doesnâ€™t change the tuple.
    You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple.
